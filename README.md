# Training plotting

Plotting my training data because I'm a nerd and a jock :muscle:

GitHub actions is automatically triggered each night to scrape the data from my training data in Google sheets, re-render the HTML from the RMarkdown file and re-create the GitHub webpage

Plenty to do on the plotting side of things once I find time and headspace :)

This code has been created for personal use. However I plan to add documentation and example input Google Sheets so others can use/adapt the code for their own use. Then, with some setup, you'd be able to record your training data in a Google Spreadsheet and have a github page updated nightly with a few useful plots/tables of your data similar to: https://leahkemp.github.io/training_plotting/. Then if you'd like, you can adapt the code to generate your own custom plots/tables.
