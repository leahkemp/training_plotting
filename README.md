# Training plotting

Plotting my training data because I'm a nerd and a jock

GitHub actions is automatically triggered each night to scrape the data from my training data in Google sheets, re-render the HTML from the RMarkdown file and re-create the GitHub webpage

Plenty to do on the plotting side of things once I find time and headspace :)
